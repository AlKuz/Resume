    I began my machine learning career in 2016 in a research area, then I began my professional career as a computer
    vision specialist and Python backend developer.
    Over time, I worked on different ML projects which are connected to Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,
    and some experience with classical tabular data.
    Right now I am actively learning Reinforcement Learning mostly for my personal interest.
    The main domains are industry, healthcare, and several projects with finance including investment analytics for my
    pet project.
    Regarding cloud providers, I prefer to use AWS to build Machine Learning and Data Processing pipelines based on
    serverless technologies.
    From a management skill perspective, I have experience in leading small Data Science teams and customer
    communication to make the process as clear as possible for them.
    Gained a lot of experience working with AWS cloud technologies.
    Now I plan to build my career in the Machine Learning Architect direction.
